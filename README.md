# ZurichRUserMeetup 29th of September 2016
This Repository contains the Slides and Demo Code used for my presentation at the Zurich R User Meetup regarding Fast Prototyping with R - or a brief introduction of R shiny.

This repo contains:
* The presented slides with all the links of packages, libraries or other aspects mentioned in the Rpresentation (-> folder MeetupPresentation)
* The mini standard hello-world example, with only few modifications (-> DemoBasic)
* The more extended example (-> DemoExamples)

Nadja


PS: Remark - for simplicity reasons, I added the JSON files for the demo as well. They're not too big though.
