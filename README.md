# ZurichRUserMeetup 29th of September 2016
This Repository contains the Slides and Demo Code used for my presentation at the [Zurich R User Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zurich-R-User-Group/events/234114417/) regarding Fast Prototyping with R - or a brief introduction of R shiny.

**Abstract of the Talk**
We all agree – R is great. However, if someone usually works on Excel or on a nice GUI, a programming-like IDE as R-Studio might be quite intimidating.

And then, even if an algorithm or solution is awesome from a technical point of view, it might be not enough.

Selling your solution, your approach and your idea often goes along with making it accessible to different people, mostly from other fields as yours.

Accessibility is strongly related to user experience. I’d like to share and discuss some of my examples & best practices on prototyping with R shiny with you.

**Overview**
This repo contains:
* The presented slides with all the links of packages, libraries or other aspects mentioned in the Rpresentation (-> folder MeetupPresentation)
* The mini standard hello-world example, with only few modifications (-> DemoBasic)
* The more extended example (-> DemoExamples)


regards,
Nadja


PS: Remark - for simplicity reasons, I added the JSON files for the demo as well. They're not too big though.
